# Callrec Phone

A plain, private phone app for Android that **records your calls**. It replaces the dialer, shows who is calling, and saves each call as an audio file on your phone. No account, no ads, no tracking, no cloud: your calls, contacts and recordings never leave the device.
This is a Public build version for the app I made for my current employers. 

It is also the reference app for [**callrec**](https://github.com/Youbal-oops/callrec), the small open-source library that does the recording.

> **Not yet verified on many handsets.** Call-audio capture depends on the phone maker. Please report what works and what does not.

## What you get

- **Recents, dialpad and contacts**, with search that ignores case, accents and punctuation, and finds a number however it is written.
- **A full call screen**: answer, decline, silence the ringer, mute, speaker or Bluetooth, hold, keypad, end.
- **Saved names from everywhere**: Google, phone storage and SIM contacts are merged, and each name shows where it is saved.
- **A note per number**, shown on the call screen when that person calls or you call them.
- **Automatic call recording** once a call connects. Play, share or delete from the Recordings tab. Old recordings can delete themselves after 7, 30 or 90 days.
- **A built-in setup guide** (Settings → Setup) with a tick for each step, and a "how it works" list.
- **Problem reports stay on the phone.** If something breaks, Settings shows the error with a Copy button.

## Setup

The same steps are in the app under **Settings → Setup**, with a tick for each one that is done.

1. **Allow restricted settings, then the permissions.** Phone Settings → Apps → Callrec Phone → ⋮ (top right) → **Allow restricted settings** (needed for apps installed from an APK). Then tap **Allow permissions** in the app (contacts, call log, phone, microphone, notifications).
2. **Set Callrec Phone as your default phone app.**
3. **Start recording access** (to record *both* sides of a call; skip it to record with the microphone only). In the app tap **Pair and start**, then:
   1. Turn on **Developer options** (tap *Build number* seven times in *About phone*) and, inside it, **Wireless debugging**. Wi-Fi must be on.
   2. Tap **Pair device with pairing code** and leave that box open.
   3. Pull down the notification from Callrec Phone and type the six-digit code into it.
   You only pair once. **After every restart, open the app and tap Start** (Wireless debugging has to be on while it starts). Needs Android 11 or newer.
   *Prefer the Shizuku app?* Install [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/download/), start it ([its guide](https://shizuku.rikka.app/guide/setup/)), and allow Callrec Phone in it. Both work; the app uses whichever is on.
4. **Make a short test call.** The recording appears in the **Recordings** tab.

## How recording works

Android only lets *system* apps capture the other person's voice during a call. There is no setting to switch on. The ways around it are root, the phone maker's own recorder, or borrowing the rights of Android's `shell` user, which is what `adb` runs as.

Callrec Phone does the last one **by itself**. Wireless debugging (Android 11+) lets a device be paired with a code and then run shell commands. The app pairs with *its own phone*, then starts a tiny recorder process as the shell user. That process records the call audio and saves it in the app's folder; the app only tells it when to start and stop. This is the same idea as Shizuku, built in, so no second app is needed.

It has the same limits as Shizuku: the recorder process does not survive a restart (tap **Start** again), Wireless debugging has to be on while it starts, and phones can differ in whether call audio can be captured at all. Without it, the app records with the microphone, which hears the other person only on speakerphone.

## Privacy

- Everything stays on the phone. There is no server, no sign-in and no analytics. Calls, contacts, notes and recordings never leave the device.
- **About the network permission.** The app asks for `INTERNET` and a few Wi-Fi permissions. Android requires `INTERNET` for *any* network socket, even one to the phone itself, and that is the only reason: it talks to this phone's own wireless debugging on `127.0.0.1` and looks for its pairing dialog on the local network. Nothing in the code contacts any other server, and the source is here to check (search for `http` or `Socket`). If that is not acceptable to you, the microphone mode and the Shizuku-app mode need none of it, and you can remove the permission and build the app yourself.
- Recordings are kept in the app's own folder (`Android/data/dev.youbal.callrecphone/files/Recordings`). Other apps cannot read them. Sharing is always an explicit action you take.
- The recorder process talks to the app through a few small files in that folder, protected by a random secret kept in the app's private storage, so another app cannot give it orders.
- Saved names are read from your contacts only to show and search them, and are not stored by the app.

## Recording calls and the law

Recording a call can require the consent of everyone on it, depending on where you live. **You are responsible for following the law.** Tell people when you record them.

## Build it yourself

You need JDK 17 and the Android SDK (API 35).

```
git clone https://github.com/Youbal-oops/Phone
cd Phone
./gradlew assembleDebug testDebugUnitTest lintDebug
```

The recording library comes from JitPack. To work on the library and the app together, clone [callrec](https://github.com/Youbal-oops/callrec) **next to this folder**; the build uses that copy automatically.

## Roadmap

- Start the recorder automatically after a restart when Wireless debugging is already on.
- Optional on-device transcription.
- Voicemail and call blocking.
